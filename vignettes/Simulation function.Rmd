## Simulation Function

The `simulate_and_compare` function allows users to compare the performance of LDWAS and GWASbyCor through simulation. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:

```R
simulation_results <- simulate_and_compare(n = 100, m = 1000, num_causal = 10, effect_size = 0.5, num_covariates = 2, num_replicates = 30)
