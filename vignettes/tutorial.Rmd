Description of Package Functions
1. run_LDWAS
Purpose: Performs LD-aware GWAS using GLM while incorporating principal components (PCs) as covariates.

Inputs:

y: Phenotype vector (n x 1).

X: Genotype matrix (n x m).

C: Covariate matrix (n x t).

snp_info: SNP information data frame.

num_pcs: Number of PCs to extract (default: 10).

threshold: Tolerance for linear dependence (default: 1e-6).

alpha: Significance level (default: 0.05).

Outputs:

p_values: Vector of p-values for each SNP.

significant_snps: Data frame of significantly associated SNPs.

manhattan_plot: Manhattan plot of p-values.

qq_plot: QQ plot of p-values.

2. GWAS_GLM
Purpose: Performs GWAS using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

Inputs:

y: Phenotype vector (n x 1).

X: Genotype matrix (n x m).

C: Covariate matrix (n x t).

Outputs:

p_values: Vector of p-values for each SNP.

3. GWASbyCor
Purpose: Performs GWAS by testing the correlation between each SNP and the phenotype.

Inputs:

y: Phenotype vector (n x 1).

X: Genotype matrix (n x m).

C: Covariate matrix (n x t).

Outputs:

p_values: Vector of p-values for each SNP.

significant_snps: Data frame of significantly associated SNPs.

4. PCA_Cofactors
Purpose: Performs PCA on genotype data and excludes PCs that are linearly dependent on covariates.

Inputs:

X: Genotype matrix (n x m).

C: Covariate matrix (n x t).

threshold: Tolerance for linear dependence (default: 1e-6).

Outputs:

pcs: Matrix of selected PCs (n x k).

5. simulate_and_compare
Purpose: Simulates genotype and phenotype data, runs LDWAS and GWASbyCor, and compares their performance.

Inputs:

n: Number of individuals.

m: Number of SNPs.

num_causal: Number of causal SNPs.

effect_size: Effect size of causal SNPs.

num_covariates: Number of covariates.

num_replicates: Number of replicates.

Outputs:

Data frame with performance metrics (power, FPR, precision, recall, runtime).


# Introduction

LDWAS is a package that performs PCA and incorporate PCs as cofactors for GWAS; it also automatically exclude the PCs that are in linear dependence with the covariates provided by users. The package also generates several diagnostic plots and analyses.

# Description of Package Functions

## `run_LDWAS`

The primary function in this package is `run_LDWAS`, which performs GWAS while incorporating principal components and generating several outputs. Here's a description of the key parameters:


##Step-by-Step Tutorial

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yourusername/LDWAS")
library(LDWAS)

##Simulate Data
set.seed(123)
y <- rnorm(100)  # Phenotype
X <- matrix(sample(0:2, 100 * 1000, replace = TRUE), nrow = 100)  # Genotype
C <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 2), nrow = 100)  # Covariates
snp_info <- data.frame(SNP = paste0("rs", 1:1000), Chromosome = rep(1:10, each = 100), Position = 1:1000)

##Run LDWAS
results <- run_LDWAS(y, X, C, snp_info, correction_method = "fdr")
print(results$significant_snps)

##Compare Methods
simulation_results <- simulate_and_compare(n = 100, m = 1000, num_causal = 10, effect_size = 0.5, num_covariates = 2, num_replicates = 30)
print(simulation_results)


##Common Questions and Answers
Q1: Why am I getting an error about the pipe operator (%>%)?
A: The pipe operator is part of the dplyr package. Load dplyr using library(dplyr).

Q2: Why are no significant SNPs being detected?
A: This could be due to a low effect size or a strict significance threshold. Try reducing the alpha value or increasing the effect_size.

Q3: How do I interpret the Manhattan plot?
A: The Manhattan plot shows the p-values for each SNP across the genome. Peaks above the significance threshold indicate potential associations.

Q4: Can I use this package for binary traits?
A: Yes, use the family = binomial() argument in the GWAS_GLM function.

Q5: How do I handle missing data?
A: The package automatically removes SNPs with missing or constant values. You can also preprocess your data to impute missing values.
